        <p>Malbec primarily comes from Argentina and France, although it is usually known primarily as an Argentine wine. The wine originated in France, but the grapes used to make Malbec had a tough time surviving the weather and pests of France. A French botanist took the grapes to Argentina and planted them in Mendoza, and the grapes and wine thrived!</p>

        This is a dry wine with medium to high tannins. Extended oak aging softens the tannins and brings out spicy notes that underpin dark fruit flavors. It typically has a 13 - 15% ABV, with most varieties hitting the top end.</p>
